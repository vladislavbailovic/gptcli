Once you enter the password, it will create an encoded version of the file named `test.txt.gpg` in the current directory. The original file `test.txt` will be left unchanged.\n\nNote that encoding (encryption) and decoding (decryption) are often used interchangeably. But technically, encoding is the process of converting data into a different format, while encryption is the process of encoding data to make it unreadable without a special key or password."},"finish_reason":"stop","index":0}]}
